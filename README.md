# üöó ESP32 Smart Wi-Fi Controlled Car

A feature-rich IoT-based RC car using the ESP32 microcontroller. This project allows you to control the car via a local Wi-Fi web interface and includes a variety of components like an LED matrix display, obstacle detection, buzzer alerts, and blinking LEDs.

## üìå Features

- ‚úÖ Control movement: Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Stop
- ‚úÖ Wi-Fi Web Server interface to control everything
- ‚úÖ Obstacle detection using Ultrasonic Sensor
- ‚úÖ LED Matrix Display (8x32) with:
  - Custom scrolling text
  - Brightness control
- ‚úÖ Passive Buzzer for alerts
- ‚úÖ Blinking LEDs as indicators
- ‚úÖ Smooth user interaction via browser on any phone/laptop

## üß† How It Works

- The **ESP32** creates a web server after connecting to Wi-Fi.
- You can connect from any browser on the same network to control the car.
- A **motor driver (L293D)** controls the car‚Äôs direction.
- An **ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)** detects obstacles and stops the car if something is in front.
- An **LED matrix (8x32)** displays scrolling text, which can be customized via the web interface.
- A **3-pin passive buzzer** plays a tone on command or during obstacle alerts.

| Component       | ESP32 Pin   | Notes                             |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Motor ENA      | GPIO 22     | Motor A Enable                    |
| Motor IN1      | GPIO 21     | Motor A Input 1                   |
| Motor IN2      | GPIO 19     | Motor A Input 2                   |
| Motor ENB      | GPIO 17     | Motor B Enable                    |
| Motor IN3      | GPIO 16     | Motor B Input 1                   |
| Motor IN4      | GPIO 4      | Motor B Input 2                   |
| LED Matrix CLK | GPIO 18     | Use with SPI                      |
| LED Matrix DATA| GPIO 23     |                                   |
| LED Matrix CS  | GPIO 5      |                                   |
| Ultrasonic TRIG| GPIO 27     |                                   |
| Ultrasonic ECHO| GPIO 26     | Use voltage divider (5V ‚Üí 3.3V)   |
| Buzzer (SIG)   | GPIO 14     | 3-pin passive buzzer (tone)       |
| LED 1          | GPIO 12     |                                   |
| LED 2          | GPIO 13     |                                   |

**Note:**
- Supply ESP32 with **3.3V regulated** from AMS1117 or USB.
- Use **external 6V‚Äì9V battery** to power motors.
- Use a **voltage divider** for ECHO pin of ultrasonic sensor to avoid damaging ESP32.
